# At any given point on the analyzer crystal there is a line along with
# scattered rays will perfectly match the Bragg condition of the crystal
# and be passed through that point.  Because the crystals are wide transverse
# to the beam, there is a plane of scattering locations that will each pass
# through a line on on the crystal.
# 
# For scattering locations displaced from this plane by small distances the
# rays may still be passed if the displacement is small enough that the
# deviation of the ray is less than the Darwin width of the crystal will still be
# passed.
#
# The size of the region that will be accepted is larger the farther the scattering
# location is from the crystal, thus the gauge volume is a wedge shape.

# This displacement is perpendicular to the plane of ideal scattering, thus as the crystal is rotated
# around the sample, there is a volume of sample that is always visible to the detector.  
# Thus, for a perfectly aligned crystal with an infinitely thin detector a scan will sample a sphere
# of the sample that is measured at every position and a shell of locations that are sampled at only
# a small range of crystal positions.  If the center of the circle the detector are on is not concentric
# with the rotation axis of the diffractometer the volume sampled at all positions will be hollowed out
# to a shell until there is no consistently sampled volume.  Thus we want the two circles to be concentric
# to within 2 um (1/3 the gauge width at 40keV an 1m)
